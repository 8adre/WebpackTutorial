Imagine that you've used webpack to bundle all your files together, and now you've realized that all together it's 900KB. This is a problem that can be ameliorated by minifying your bundle. To do this you need to use a plugin I mentioned earlier called the [UglifyJsPlugin](https://webpack.github.io/docs/list-of-plugins.html#uglifyjsplugin).

Moreover you will need to have webpack installed locally to actually be able to use the plugin.

    npm install --save-dev webpack

Now you can require webpack and minify your code.

```javascript
// webpack.config.js
var path = require('path')
var webpack = require('webpack')

module.exports = {
  entry: ['./src/index'], // .js after index is optional
  output: {
    path: path.join(__dirname, 'dist'),
    filename: 'bundle.js'
  },
  plugins: [
    new webpack.optimize.UglifyJsPlugin({
      compressor: {
        warnings: false,
      },
    })
  ]
}
```
Going over the new properties one by one:

* plugins - An array that holds your plugins.
  * [webpack.optimize.UglifyJsPlugin](https://webpack.github.io/docs/list-of-plugins.html#uglifyjsplugin) - Minify your code, and suppress warning messages.

When you run `webpack`, this will create a file called `bundle.js` in the dist folder; however, now that you have the `UglifyJsPlugin` this could reduce your imaginary 900KB file to 200KB by through processes such as removing all the whitespace.

You can also add the [OrderOccurencePlugin](https://webpack.github.io/docs/list-of-plugins.html#occurrenceorderplugin)

> Assign the module and chunk ids by occurrence count. Ids that are used often get lower (shorter) ids. This make ids predictable, reduces to total file size and is recommended.

To be honest I'm not sure how the underlying mechanisms work, but it says recommended so why not just throw it in your config.

```javascript
// webpack.config.js
var path = require('path')
var webpack = require('webpack')

module.exports = {
  entry: ['./src/index'], // .js after index is optional
  output: {
    path: path.join(__dirname, 'dist'),
    filename: 'bundle.js'
  },
  plugins: [
    new webpack.optimize.UglifyJsPlugin({
      compressor: {
        warnings: false,
      },
    }),
    new webpack.optimize.OccurenceOrderPlugin()
  ]
}
```
